I summarize my ability:  
I'm from China which is a fierce-competed country and My original major is accounting.I have middle-level skills on python, accounting and english.  
what i want to do next:  
1.python's code design logic:i am not good at the logic of any application.i didnot acquire the systemic education about the code's world.  
2.english learning:maybe it is enough to handle every english test in China,i can not accept only live domestic.If it is possible, i prefer to be in Hong-Kong   
3.Frence learning:i take language like a tool. Actually, it is.  
hope to be a better one.'''

i am here to declare i do not want to be a nitte anymore.i am fed up with fearing the changingable world, Internet has got me mad for everything i saw is booming.  
After played the epic game 'edith finch's memory'(maybe it is not its real name),i really decided to write down my feelings about everydays' life.  
i will take this place as a journal to set my goal and try to reach it.  
You know,it is hard to keep our innovate heart in the chaos.what i see everyday is barely junks who is playing the junk game allday.  
I can be sure i know why they done like this,they are same as me.I have live for a invisible score before,i lose my destination at college.  
i want to see my daily-life can be changed since i have been dizzy during past 2 years.  
hope this dairy will keep an eye on what i am doing everyday so i won't be so down after the next 2 years.  
sincerely,yours
